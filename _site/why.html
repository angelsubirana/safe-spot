<h2>Do you know where your kids are?</h2>

<h3>The experts say: “The first step for your kids being safe is monitoring where they are”.</h3>

<p>Research indicates that teens with unsupervised time are three times more likely to use drugs. Unsupervised teens are also more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as underage drinking, carnal activities, and cigarette smoking than other teens. This is particularly important after school, in the evening hours, and also when school is out during the summer or holidays.</p>

<p>To sum up, in order to prevent potentially dangerous behaviors, experts recommend:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check that your kids are where they are supposed to be.</li>
  <li>Know in advance what he or she will be doing during the unsupervised time.</li>
  <li>Check that they are spending time with who they are supposed to be.</li>
</ol>
